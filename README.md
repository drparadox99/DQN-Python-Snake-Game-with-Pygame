# üêç DQN (RL) Snake Game in Python

A simple Snake Game built with **Pygame**, trained using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**.  
This project demonstrates reinforcement learning in action‚Äîteaching an agent to play the classic Snake game from scratch using its own experiences.

This project implements a **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** agent to play the classic Snake game. The AI learns to play the game through reinforcement learning in action-teaching, using **Pygame** for visualization and a simple MLP neural network in Pytorch to train the agent.

## üß† Deep Q-Learning (DQN)

The AI agent uses Deep Q-Learning to learn how to play the Snake game. It interacts with the environment, stores experiences in memory, and learns optimal actions via Q-value estimation using a neural network.

Key concepts used:

- Experience Replay
- Epsilon-Greedy Strategy
- Target Network
- State Representation (Grid-based)
